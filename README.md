scala-graph-search-lib
================

Generic scala library for common graph search algorithms. 
Have implementations for:
 * BFS
 * A* (A-star)

Other algorithms might in the future be added when needed, 
such as:
 * bidirectional BFS
 * ID (Iterative deepening)
 * IDA* 
 * ...
 
Code dependencies
-----------------
No dependencies for production code, besides Scala Standard 
Library (2.9). Test code has dependency to Scalatest (1.9.1). 
Other versions of the dependencies might also work (not tested).
